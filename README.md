# Visualization-of-H-1B-Visa-dataset-to-analyze-job-trends-in-The-USA-using-Tableau-  
The H-1B is a visa in the United States that allows employers to temporarily employ foreign
workers in specialty occupations. The specialty occupation requires the application of
specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or the equivalent of work experience.  

This visualization will analyse the data and try to find out which
professions have highest chances to get jobs in the US. **I created an extensive dashboard in a storytelling way, which will be helpful to any foreign individual who is looking for job in the USA**, wants to know
in which fields there are highest possibilities of getting job, relevant salary information and
which posts are most desirables by the employers.
